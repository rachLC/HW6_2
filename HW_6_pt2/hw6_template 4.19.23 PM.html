<h1>Homework 6: Normalized Census Data Choropleth </h1>
<h2>YOUR NAME</h2>
<h3>I chose to create a ratio of the number of households recieving SNAP benefits in the last 12 months per county to the total number of households per county.  I used this ratio to normalize the data, as some representations of this information can be misleading if one county has a significantly higher population, as it would most likely also have a significant higher number of households recieving SNAP benefits.  However, creating this ratio demonstrates how much of a specific county's population is recieving SNAP benefits and therefore gives us a better idea of the level of food security in that county in relation to the rest of South Carolina's counties. </h3>
